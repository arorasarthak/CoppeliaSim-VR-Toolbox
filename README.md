# CoppeliaSim-VR-Toolbox for Linux (Refactored)
This is a wip linux port of the CoppeliaSim-VR-Toolbox originally developed by Boris Bogaerts.

Currently only a non-vr version is available as. Hence, the name "novr".

The project is under development and an OpenVR version will be added soon.


Instructions for installation coming soon.
